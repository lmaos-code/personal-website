## about this document

This document is an attempt to write down my principles, preferences, and how I think about work.
The goal is to set us up for a better, more effective collaboration from the start.
This is a living document, so expect it to change as I continue to figure things out.

# North Star Principles

These are the core values that guide my work.

## 1. Embrace your inner technology-obsessed kid

That one day I understood the concept of a domain at five years old resulted in me being here today.
And to this day it is that kid that I would like to show the incredible things humans have dreamt up.
Now imagine the dissapointment, that kid would have on it's face when you show it some mediocre software.
That kid really valued quality and curious software - he just didn't know that at the time.

## 2. Ask for forgiveness instead of permission

Of course, this is within reason.
I have often had the experience, that when you go outside of the box you have been assigned, you and your peers reap the rewards.

## 3. Better; Together

When being alone would mean to be better off, wouldn't everyone be doing it?
Bringing together our viewpoints, ideas and reasoning makes our Output better.

## 4. Not given, earned - every day

Since I was a child, I have had a fundamental dislike for hierachies.
Neither age, experience nor your paygrade determine if you have the best Idea for our problem at hand.

## 5. Lies, damned lies - no need for statistics

I fundamentally belief, that people develop a sense for corporate tomfoolery.
Stop telling me you are a big family.
Tell me you want me to occasionally work on the weekend.

# Work

## My Ideal Cadence

I enjoy a hybrid work model and would choose it if given the option.
My current agreement is three days at home and two at the office, which I like.
I value having two different environments where I can focus.

## My Ideal Environment

I produce my best work in a focused, quiet environment.
I can be distracted easily by noise and other interruptions.
To perform at my best, I require dedicated, meeting-free and communication-free time slots.
This culture of dedicated focus time is something I value highly.
Constant interruptions lead to lost time and context switching.

## My Typical Hours

Flexible work hours are a foundational necessity for me.
My natural rhythm is to start late and stay late.
Given the choice, I prefer to start my focused work after 9:00 AM.
I then work until 17:00 or 19:00, depending on my engagement and flow.

## My Philosophy on Hierarchy

I have always struggled with hierarchical structures.
I now understand their necessity to some degree, but I still don't enjoy them.
This comes from a core belief that authority must be earned, not simply given by a title.
In my line of work, decisions are best made by those with the right information.
Often, the people in charge lack skin in the game or are missing key information.
This can lead to decisions that negatively impact others but not the decision-maker.

## My Approach to Decisions

Decisions, by their nature, involve an element of the unknown.
My decisions are primarily technical.
When possible, I first explore the problem space to eliminate foundational unknowns.
This exploration helps me form an opinion and identify what I believe is the best bet.

## My Approach to Team Decisions

When a team needs to agree, I prefer a small group of the most-informed people to lead the discussion.
I've had great success using [Systemic Consensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_Consensing).
I don't mean the formal ritual of scoring, but the principle of finding the path with the highest agreeableness.
When using this, one must be wary of [design by committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_committee).
When I recognize we are movin in such a direction, I will retract my vote to avoid a watered-down, compromised solution.
I believe one strong, uncompromised solution (even one I dislike) is better than a mediocre compromise.
In these moments, I am happy to [disagree and commit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit).

# Communicate

## The Best Way: In Person

Let's grab a coffee.
I wholeheartedly believe that in-person communication supercharges all other communication.
This leads to far greater outcomes.
When I first get to know you, I will try to get you a coffee and chat to you.

## The Worst Way: E-Mail

I dread E-Mails.
I love the _idea_ of Inbox Zero, but I rarely succeed at it.
E-Mail carries a perceived heft that I find burdensome.
I also have a personal thesis that E-Mails always address too many and not enough people at once.
They are often used for wide-reaching decisions.
The decision process should be small, but the resulting information should be communicated broadly.
E-Mail culture often fails at this second part.

## My Preferred Channels (_In Order_)

1. In Person / Workshop
2. Short Messaging Service (e.g., Slack, Teams, SMS)
3. Call
4. E-Mail

## How to Give Me Feedback

I wish I could say "be direct and to my face," but that doesn't really work for me.
I am still figuring out the optimal way to receive feedback.
For thoughtful, heartfelt, or mission-critical feedback, I prefer it in written form.
This gives me the time and space to reflect on it properly.
I do this best when I am alone, usually in from of a notepad or keyboard.
Please afford me the time reflect after you give me the feedback.
Either you will see a change in behaviour, or receive a direct response.

## A Note on Compliments

From my time as a handball goalkeeper, I developed the notion that compliments made me perform worse.
I preferred praise to be directed at the team's effort, not just at me directly.
I am not this strict anymore and can handle a compliment.
However, I encourage you to also check if there are shoulders I am standing on.
If so, please share the flowers with them as well.

# quirks, features and errata

This is a catch-all for things that don't fit elsewhere.

- I am always up for a good coffee.
- My humor can be a bit dry at times.
- I appreciate puns and well-timed jokes.
- The more I get to know you, the more I will start to swear
