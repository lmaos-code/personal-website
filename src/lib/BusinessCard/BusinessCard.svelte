		I'm Manuel Otto Santovenia, a Cloud Engineer at R+V running Cloud Infrastructure on Azure. Beyond my work photography allows me to capture moments and see the world through a different lens, while my interest in design fuels a constant appreciation for aesthetics and user experience. I also love the challenge and satisfaction of building tiny software projects ‚Äì bringing digital ideas to life, one small step at a time. </br>
		Learning is a continuous journey for me, and I'm currently in the process of completing my Master's degree. I also find great joy in sharing knowledge and helping others understand new concepts, whether it's teaching students or simply explaining a technical detail to a colleague. And when I need to clear my head and recharge, you'll likely find me out on my bike, exploring the world on two wheels.</br>
		Ultimately, my goal is to create things, whether it's robust cloud infrastructure or a simple piece of software, that can make people smile or make their lives a little bit better. If you want to see this for yourself, you can checkout my <a href="https://github.com/lmaos-code">GitHub Profile</a>.</br>

		He‚Äôs is a lifelong learner, currently pursuing his Master's degree, and loves sharing his knowledge with others, whether in a teaching environment or a casual conversation. And when he's not immersed in technology or studies, he enjoys exploring the world on his bike.`
